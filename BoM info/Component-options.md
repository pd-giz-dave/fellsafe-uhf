# LoRa
Can't find anything that beats the Pycom FiPy

# LTE-M and NB-Iot
Can't find anything that beats the Pycom FiPy

# m5stack
This is a system that is easy to plug together, so would be simpler for DIY configuration. Suitable modules are:
- GPS $28.50
- NB-IoT $29.90
- LoRaWAN $21.95
- Basic Core, ESP32 Arduino compatible, $27.95 (includes WiFi, Bluetooth, RTC)
- Proto module, to do RS232 I/F to UHF reader, power regulation, $2.95
- or COMMU RS484 module, $11.39

More expensive and the ESP32 has limited capability (its whats in the FiPy)
